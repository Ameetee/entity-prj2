<!-- To convert the given entity-relationship (ER) model to a relational diagram, the following steps are taken: 

1. Identify Entities and Attributes
From the ER diagram provided, identify the entities, their attributes, and any relationships between them. -->

Hotel

Attributes: HotelID (pk), Name

Room

Attributes: RoomID (PK), floor
Category:
Attributes: CategoryID (PK), Name, price, Beds_numbers(fk)

Type: 
Attributes: Type i.d, Name

Employee:
Attributes: EmployeeID (PK), EmployeenameID (pK), Employee-Specialty (FK)

2. Convert Entities to Tables
For each entity, create a table with columns corresponding to the entity's attributes:

Hotel Table

HotelID (Primary Key)
Name

Room Table

RoomID (Primary Key)
floor 

Type Table

Type_id (primary key)
Type_name (foreign key)

Category Table
CategoryID (Primary Key)
categoryName 
price
Beds numbers(fk)

Employee Table

EmployeeID (Primary Key)
Employee_name (Foreign Key)
Employee specialty

3. Define Relationships and Foreign Keys
Identify how tables relate to each other through foreign keys:

Room Table has a foreign key HotelID that references Hotel Table.
CategoryTable has foreign keys CategoryID and RoomID that reference Room Table and hotel table respectively.
4. Design the Relational Diagram
The relational diagram (also known as the relational schema) includes tables, their attributes, and relationships (foreign keys). Hereâ€™s how it will look:




Hotel
------------------------
HotelID (PK)
Name


Room
------------------------
RoomID (PK)
HotelID (FK) --> References Hotel(HotelID)
floor

Category
------------------------
CategoryID (PK)
category Name (fk)
price
beds_NUMBERS 

Employee
------------------------
EmployeeID (PK)
Employee_Name (FK) --> References Customer(employeeID)
Employee_Specialty (FK) --> References ()
